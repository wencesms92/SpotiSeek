# SpotiSeek web app
A webb application developed in VueJS 3 framework which interacts with Spotify API endpoints. You'll be able to search for any artists, songs or albums.

This app was deployed into Firebase Hosting with the help of Github Actions. I've created an automated workflow that triggers on every pushed commit and deploys the code to Firebase. The app is deployed here: https://spotiseek.web.app/

Anyway, if you want to run this code in your browser you have to follow the steps below.

## Steps to run the app in your local

1.After download or clone the project in your local (git clone https://github.com/wencesms92/SpotiSeek.git), you have to run "npm install" in order to install all the node_modules dependencies declared in the file package.json.
2. Start your local server (localhost:8080) by running "npm run serve" and that's it!
3. Access to your localhost:8080 in the browser.
